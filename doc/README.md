# Project Documentation

This is intended as a place to collect project documentation. We can use it to reference docs that describe
- Design
- Testing
- Deployment
- anything else that seems relevant

The docs don't have to be perfect. They can evolve over time and have as much effort expended on them as deemed appropriate.
